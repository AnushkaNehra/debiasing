mnli_samples-->dpo_trainer.py (this file) has put the mnli data in the dpo format 
there is little to no need of imput,trian and ecal file to be slit and its in the file split_mnli_dpo
correct data file has put the dpo format mnli file into the mnli file into dpo with margin format 
correct_data file is converting the data to the original raw and flattened data i am working on rn , it takes the mnli_dpo_format as i/p and then the mnli_dpo_margin format as o/p and then flatten the data file and name it as cleaned_filtered_dataset and this is the one being currently used and is helpful
